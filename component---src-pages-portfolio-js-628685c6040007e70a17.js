Basically there is an  array of results (bars and locals that serve drinks) that are mapped to a react Component. Every time a user want to go to a bar, the database is updated with that user, so the database changes.  Now Meteor detects the change and so the array changes and it gets re rendered. It is not really noticeable, as React doeas a great job at rendering, but still.

The real breaking point was when I had to implement user login. I have started studying passport.js to try and implement a log in function but with no real success, so after a day I started looking into alternatives. Since freecodecamp stopped asking that all Web App projects must be made using the MEAN stack it meant that I can pick what ever framework I wanted. My first thought was Django because of my previous Python knowledge, but that quickly changed when I saw what Meteor has to offer. I had some previous interaction with Meteor since I wanted to build a project for myself about half a year prior to this project and I was pleasantly surprised about the fact that Meteor fully adopted React as it\'s rendering engine so I was hitting two birds with one stone. The project is pretty well organised and has plenty of functionality. The thing I remember was frustrating was the fact that my views were updating twice, because of the State change of the React Component and the auto-update function of Meteor. That was a problem I chose to fix when working on a later project, but that is another story. I also remember that it took a whole day to implement the fill percentage with color of the option row based on the total number of votes, the method I used was a separate div for the Text, border and actual fill. The app is not fully polished and has some minor slip ups but it works. It took me 9 days to finish including the one day experiments with different frameworks. Overall I am pleased with the result given the fact that this was way harder to make then the next two challenges.","web_link":"https://ucshadow-vote-app.herokuapp.com/","media":"https://i.imgur.com/u70EtYy.png","media_pre":"https://i.imgur.com/AliL6qt.jpg","techs":[{"id":1,"description":"A Javascript library by Facebook","name":"React","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/iHR5quf.png","tech_type":"Library, view engine","url":"https://reactjs.org/"},{"id":2,"description":"A programming language used for scripting web browser","name":"Javascript","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/DuzCxrK.png","tech_type":"Interpreted/JIT, programming language","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"},{"id":3,"description":"A CSS library for responsive web design","name":"Bootstrap","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/VgoB08x.png","tech_type":"Library, markup/CSS","url":"https://getbootstrap.com/"},{"id":7,"description":"A full stack web framework","name":"Meteor","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/Ir06L0X.png","tech_type":"Framework, full stack","url":"https://www.meteor.com/"},{"id":8,"description":"A noSQL database","name":"mongoDB","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/P6J0eER.png","tech_type":"DB, no SQL / JSON based","url":"https://www.mongodb.com/"},{"id":12,"description":"A library for visual data representation","name":"D3","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/MXykE8K.png","tech_type":"Library, javascript","url":"https://d3js.org/"}]}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/air-traffic-tracker/"},"id":"14","date":"September 15 2018","description":"Real time tracking of air traffic.

It was fun to build and fun to balance, I planned adding more stuff to the game but the browser was already struggling to render all the elements. I remember I had to adjust the tileSize (the size of every object in the game)from 32 to 24 pixels, just to get some more frames from Chrome. I also remember all the cave generators algorithms that I have tried to adapt from the online examples until I finally decided to roll my own cave generation algorithm, with blackjack.. and.. .

If I remember correctly the thing that I did wrong is that the generation calculations for each cell was done in a loop, so a cell with a lower index would behave as a new generation cell for a neighbouring cell with a higher index, so it would screw up my calculations. What I have learned from this is that looking at other people\'s code is way more productive than trying to reinvent the wheel, as long as you actually try to implement something, and not just mindless copy-pasting. The thing that I am most proud is the fact that you can add live cells as the game runs, no need to pause.

I previously had some experience with Matplotlib in Python but this was a different beast all together. What I did not know about D3 is that all the data is displayed relative to the declared domain and range of the graph, so in this first project I tried to fit the bars in by hand, with pretty good success. This looks good for a basic graph but later down the road, when graph get more complex, this won\'t do so I will find this out the hard way. One thing I did by myself here and it turned out so good that I just reused it all over my D3 projects was the tooltip. After a lot of fight with jQuery tooltip, D3 tooltip library and different html tricks that had no success I decided to roll my own tooltip component, and although the style is lacking, the functionality is in par if not even better than what I have seen those mentioned libraries do. Another thing to note is that I kept using React, even tho it was completely unnecessary, because why not consolidate your knowledge given the chance?","web_link":"http://codepen.io/_catalin/pen/yOQwPZ","media":"https://i.imgur.com/mjg4XDg.png","media_pre":"https://i.imgur.com/vo3YeBT.jpg","techs":[{"id":1,"description":"A Javascript library by Facebook","name":"React","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/iHR5quf.png","tech_type":"Library, view engine","url":"https://reactjs.org/"},{"id":2,"description":"A programming language used for scripting web browser","name":"Javascript","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/DuzCxrK.png","tech_type":"Interpreted/JIT, programming language","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"},{"id":4,"description":"A library for web scripting","name":"jQuery","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/rIRlTiM.png","tech_type":"Library, javascript","url":"https://jquery.com/"},{"id":12,"description":"A library for visual data representation","name":"D3","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/MXykE8K.png","tech_type":"Library, javascript","url":"https://d3js.org/"}]}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map/"},"id":"37","date":"May 8 2016","description":"A project built for freecodecamp.com in 2016, the requirement then were to build a heat map graph","git_link":"","name":"Visualize Data with a Heat Map","story":"How glad I am now that I have learned how D3 truly works while working at the previous project or this would have been a mess and a really stressful experience.

From how domain and range work to ticks format, D3 time format, axis styling and even SVG tricks like inserting HTML directly into SVG. After completing this project I could have said that I had some clue what D3 is about. What I found out while working on this even tho it had nothing to do with data visualisation was that text displayed with a slight shadow sticks out more than without and also that pure black does not look the best on a white or white-ish background, so a slightly \\"lighter\\" black is better.
