The only thing I regret is that I did not took a screen shot of the result when I finished the project. Shortly after, freecodecamp moved it's discussion board to reddit so the project API was no longer available. Nonetheless the project is done, the main concept are learned and even tho there is a new project that  uses a different api to achieve kinda the same result, I have decided not to change my original code and I just adjusted it al little bit to take the data from reddit.","web_link":"http://codepen.io/_catalin/pen/dMrPxJ","media":"https://i.imgur.com/SoHPVhu.png","media_pre":"https://i.imgur.com/lz7ZqwJ.jpg","techs":[{"id":1,"description":"A Javascript library by Facebook","name":"React","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/iHR5quf.png","tech_type":"Library, view engine","url":"https://reactjs.org/"},{"id":2,"description":"A programming language used for scripting web browser","name":"Javascript","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/DuzCxrK.png","tech_type":"Interpreted/JIT, programming language","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"},{"id":4,"description":"A library for web scripting","name":"jQuery","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/rIRlTiM.png","tech_type":"Library, javascript","url":"https://jquery.com/"},{"id":12,"description":"A library for visual data representation","name":"D3","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/MXykE8K.png","tech_type":"Library, javascript","url":"https://d3js.org/"}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/relationships-with-a-force-directed-graph/"}}}
