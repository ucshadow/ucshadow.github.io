It made you learn the topojson library that worked with the  D3 geo location function. It was big, it had big data, new notions, the globe, and area of effect circles but despite that, the only problem I had was rendering a world map that does not lag your PC to death. After some experimentation I realised that the thing that eats the most resource are actually the country borders, but it would not look the same without them. I would brag about the fact that my implementation of the \"geograph\" performed better (and maybe to this day still does) than the freecodecamp example. The thing I remember from this is that I could not make a satisfying function that will display the circles directly related to the asteroid mass, because it would make some be so tiny that would not render and some would cover whole continents so I had to compromise and the result, although a lot smoother, is not as impressive. The thing that I have learned while working at this project is that maybe browsers are not ready for this kind of renderings yet, at least not the old fashioned way using SVG or HTML, because with WebGL this would have been a lot smoother.","web_link":"http://codepen.io/_catalin/full/oxOZmY","media":"https://i.imgur.com/LBsbtB9.png","media_pre":"https://i.imgur.com/TUUji43.jpg","techs":[{"id":1,"description":"A Javascript library by Facebook","name":"React","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/iHR5quf.png","tech_type":"Library, view engine","url":"https://reactjs.org/"},{"id":2,"description":"A programming language used for scripting web browser","name":"Javascript","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/DuzCxrK.png","tech_type":"Interpreted/JIT, programming language","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"},{"id":4,"description":"A library for web scripting","name":"jQuery","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/rIRlTiM.png","tech_type":"Library, javascript","url":"https://jquery.com/"},{"id":12,"description":"A library for visual data representation","name":"D3","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/MXykE8K.png","tech_type":"Library, javascript","url":"https://d3js.org/"}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/map-data-across-the-globe/"}}}
