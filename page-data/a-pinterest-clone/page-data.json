It was uninspired named \"Cards\" but, well, it is a great describing name because it uses the Material UI   Card component. The site is designed following Material Design guides and it looks good and simple.  It also uses a custom made \"Masonry\" type grid since I did not want to include Masonry.js into my project. What I remember is having to implement shouldComponentUpdate because the pictures would keep re rendering when you voted on a post, so I had to make the vote buttons into different Components and only update those Components on new data. It was a great learning experience and an even greater introduction to Material design.","web_link":"https://ucshadow-cards.herokuapp.com/","media":"https://i.imgur.com/XSnb4j3.png","media_pre":"https://i.imgur.com/OHWxt2e.jpg","techs":[{"id":1,"description":"A Javascript library by Facebook","name":"React","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/iHR5quf.png","tech_type":"Library, view engine","url":"https://reactjs.org/"},{"id":2,"description":"A programming language used for scripting web browser","name":"Javascript","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/DuzCxrK.png","tech_type":"Interpreted/JIT, programming language","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"},{"id":6,"description":"A library for responsive web design by Google, ported from the Android framework set of guides about UI","name":"Material UI","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/XtZlSEo.png","tech_type":"Library, javascript","url":"https://material-ui.com/"},{"id":7,"description":"A full stack web framework","name":"Meteor","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/Ir06L0X.png","tech_type":"Framework, full stack","url":"https://www.meteor.com/"}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/a-pinterest-clone/"}}}
