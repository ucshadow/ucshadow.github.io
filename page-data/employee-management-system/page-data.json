Built using JavaFx SceneBuilder.","git_link":"https://github.com/ucshadow/SEP2","name":"Employee management system","story":"The second semester project we had at VIA University. This was more complex than the first one since the requirements were to build a client-server system that supported multiple clients and a database in Postgres. The team was the same as in the first semester, the difference was that we now used SCRUM as a project management tool, and this was a big part of the project. \nFull process report, project report and SCRUM documentation were required and can be provided. The profile pictures used in the project image are cached google image pictures.","web_link":"","media":"https://i.imgur.com/w0Ec2cX.png","media_pre":"https://i.imgur.com/tDCUE4u.jpg","techs":[{"id":9,"description":"A programming language by Sun/Oracle","name":"Java","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/DInGJq4.png","tech_type":"Compiled, programming language","url":"https://www.java.com/"},{"id":11,"description":"An open-source SQL database","name":"Postgres","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/lvYS6WP.png","tech_type":"DB, SQL language","url":"https://www.postgresql.org/"}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/employee-management-system/"}}}
