Basically pull data from the Foursquare API, and use that data locally. The only thing that I do not like is that every time you click that you are going, all the results get re rendered. Basically there is an  array of results (bars and locals that serve drinks) that are mapped to a react Component. Every time a user want to go to a bar, the database is updated with that user, so the database changes.  Now Meteor detects the change and so the array changes and it gets re rendered. It is not really noticeable, as React doeas a great job at rendering, but still. Overall an easier project.","web_link":"https://ucshadow-nightlife-coord-app.herokuapp.com/","media":"https://i.imgur.com/cDWDyye.png","media_pre":"https://i.imgur.com/mkZUSpy.jpg","techs":[{"id":1,"description":"A Javascript library by Facebook","name":"React","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/iHR5quf.png","tech_type":"Library, view engine","url":"https://reactjs.org/"},{"id":2,"description":"A programming language used for scripting web browser","name":"Javascript","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/DuzCxrK.png","tech_type":"Interpreted/JIT, programming language","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"},{"id":3,"description":"A CSS library for responsive web design","name":"Bootstrap","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/VgoB08x.png","tech_type":"Library, markup/CSS","url":"https://getbootstrap.com/"},{"id":7,"description":"A full stack web framework","name":"Meteor","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/Ir06L0X.png","tech_type":"Framework, full stack","url":"https://www.meteor.com/"},{"id":8,"description":"A noSQL database","name":"mongoDB","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/P6J0eER.png","tech_type":"DB, no SQL / JSON based","url":"https://www.mongodb.com/"}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/a-nightlife-coordination-app/"}}}
