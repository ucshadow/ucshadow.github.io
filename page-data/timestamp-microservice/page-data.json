You can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date.  If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date. If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties. Example usage: https://fcc-ts-msvc.herokuapp.com/January2017,12 . What I would say about this is that working with dates in javascript is a mess. There is this great library called moment js but as far as I know the founder left the project, I wonder why... Anyways after I made this, I decided that this was to easy for me so I started Dynamic Web Application Projects, this is where the big boys where hanging and I wanted to be one of them!
