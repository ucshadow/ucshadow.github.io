The real breaking point was when I had to implement user login. I have started studying passport.js to try and implement a log in function but with no real success, so after a day I started looking into alternatives. Since freecodecamp stopped asking that all Web App projects must be made using the MEAN stack it meant that I can pick what ever framework I wanted. My first thought was Django because of my previous Python knowledge, but that quickly changed when I saw what Meteor has to offer. I had some previous interaction with Meteor since I wanted to build a project for myself about half a year prior to this project and I was pleasantly surprised about the fact that Meteor fully adopted React as it's rendering engine so I was hitting two birds with one stone. The project is pretty well organised and has plenty of functionality. The thing I remember was frustrating was the fact that my views were updating twice, because of the State change of the React Component and the auto-update function of Meteor. That was a problem I chose to fix when working on a later project, but that is another story. I also remember that it took a whole day to implement the fill percentage with color of the option row based on the total number of votes, the method I used was a separate div for the Text, border and actual fill. The app is not fully polished and has some minor slip ups but it works. It took me 9 days to finish including the one day experiments with different frameworks. Overall I am pleased with the result given the fact that this was way harder to make then the next two challenges.","web_link":"https://ucshadow-vote-app.herokuapp.com/","media":"https://i.imgur.com/u70EtYy.png","media_pre":"https://i.imgur.com/AliL6qt.jpg","techs":[{"id":1,"description":"A Javascript library by Facebook","name":"React","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/iHR5quf.png","tech_type":"Library, view engine","url":"https://reactjs.org/"},{"id":2,"description":"A programming language used for scripting web browser","name":"Javascript","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/DuzCxrK.png","tech_type":"Interpreted/JIT, programming language","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"},{"id":3,"description":"A CSS library for responsive web design","name":"Bootstrap","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/VgoB08x.png","tech_type":"Library, markup/CSS","url":"https://getbootstrap.com/"},{"id":7,"description":"A full stack web framework","name":"Meteor","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/Ir06L0X.png","tech_type":"Framework, full stack","url":"https://www.meteor.com/"},{"id":8,"description":"A noSQL database","name":"mongoDB","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/P6J0eER.png","tech_type":"DB, no SQL / JSON based","url":"https://www.mongodb.com/"},{"id":12,"description":"A library for visual data representation","name":"D3","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/MXykE8K.png","tech_type":"Library, javascript","url":"https://d3js.org/"}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/a-voting-app/"}}}
