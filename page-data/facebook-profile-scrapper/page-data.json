It uses Selenium web driver to go to a group page and then to each profile on that group and save all public data about that specific profile. It was done to enrich my knowledge about selenium and browser automation. The scrapping is not the fastest, but it does what it is supposed to. The next steps would be saving the data to a SQL database (since now is saved in json) and build a backend API that could serve data based on custom queries.","web_link":"","media":"https://i.imgur.com/aIEkaoB.png?1","media_pre":"https://i.imgur.com/ECSBD3S.jpg","techs":[{"id":5,"description":"A programming language by Microsoft","name":"C#","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/4IZ0xKa.png","tech_type":"Compiled, programming language","url":"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/"}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/facebook-profile-scrapper/"}}}
