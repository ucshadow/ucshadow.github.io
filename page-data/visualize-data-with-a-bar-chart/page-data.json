I previously had some experience with Matplotlib in Python but this was a different beast all together. What I did not know about D3 is that all the data is displayed relative to the declared domain and range of the graph, so in this first project I tried to fit the bars in by hand, with pretty good success. This looks good for a basic graph but later down the road, when graph get more complex, this won't do so I will find this out the hard way. One thing I did by myself here and it turned out so good that I just reused it all over my D3 projects was the tooltip. After a lot of fight with jQuery tooltip, D3 tooltip library and different html tricks that had no success I decided to roll my own tooltip component, and although the style is lacking, the functionality is in par if not even better than what I have seen those mentioned libraries do. Another thing to note is that I kept using React, even tho it was completely unnecessary, because why not consolidate your knowledge given the chance?","web_link":"http://codepen.io/_catalin/pen/yOQwPZ","media":"https://i.imgur.com/mjg4XDg.png","media_pre":"https://i.imgur.com/vo3YeBT.jpg","techs":[{"id":1,"description":"A Javascript library by Facebook","name":"React","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/iHR5quf.png","tech_type":"Library, view engine","url":"https://reactjs.org/"},{"id":2,"description":"A programming language used for scripting web browser","name":"Javascript","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/DuzCxrK.png","tech_type":"Interpreted/JIT, programming language","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"},{"id":4,"description":"A library for web scripting","name":"jQuery","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/rIRlTiM.png","tech_type":"Library, javascript","url":"https://jquery.com/"},{"id":12,"description":"A library for visual data representation","name":"D3","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/MXykE8K.png","tech_type":"Library, javascript","url":"https://d3js.org/"}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart/"}}}
