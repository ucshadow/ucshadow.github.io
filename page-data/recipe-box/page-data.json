This project was the one that really taught me about State, the React State to be more precise. I had a general idea about how it works but after this project I felt like I was more knowledgeable about it. Here is where I first learned about localStorage and I remember about a JSON error that took me half a day to fix, but I do not remember the specific error. The site looks pleasing to the eye, the design has slightly improved, also while working at it I have discovered the usage of float and all of a sudden the positioning of elements looked way easier than before.","web_link":"http://codepen.io/_catalin/pen/VaEZVK","media":"https://i.imgur.com/ahkeA8c.png","media_pre":"https://i.imgur.com/U0VJVn6.jpg","techs":[{"id":1,"description":"A Javascript library by Facebook","name":"React","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/iHR5quf.png","tech_type":"Library, view engine","url":"https://reactjs.org/"},{"id":2,"description":"A programming language used for scripting web browser","name":"Javascript","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/DuzCxrK.png","tech_type":"Interpreted/JIT, programming language","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"},{"id":3,"description":"A CSS library for responsive web design","name":"Bootstrap","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/VgoB08x.png","tech_type":"Library, markup/CSS","url":"https://getbootstrap.com/"},{"id":4,"description":"A library for web scripting","name":"jQuery","pic_url":"https://i.imgur.com/rIRlTiM.png","tech_type":"Library, javascript","url":"https://jquery.com/"}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/recipe-box/"}}}
