From how domain and range work to ticks format, D3 time format, axis styling and even SVG tricks like inserting HTML directly into SVG. After completing this project I could have said that I had some clue what D3 is about. What I found out while working on this even tho it had nothing to do with data visualisation was that text displayed with a slight shadow sticks out more than without and also that pure black does not look the best on a white or white-ish background, so a slightly \"lighter\" black is better.
