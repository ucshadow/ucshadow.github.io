The project uses Highcharts. At first I wanted to do the whole thing in D3 but quickly realised that the requirements are just to big for a D3  newbie to pull of, so after a quick google search I found out Highcharts has a chart type dedicated to stocks. The chart looks great, works great and it is easy to configure. Now you only need to know the stock name of the company you want to search.
